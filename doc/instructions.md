## General instructions

1. The project should provide a RESTful web service.

  a. The web service accepts a number, n, as input and returns the first n
Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0. I.e. given n  = 5, appropriate output
would represent the sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]. CHECK

  b. Given a negative number, it will respond with an appropriate error. CHECK

2. Include whatever instructions are necessary to build and deploy/run the
project, where "deploy/run" means the web service is accepting requests
and responding to them as appropriate.

3. Include some unit and/or functional tests

4. Use any language that you know well

While this project is admittedly trivial, approach it as representing a
more complex problem that you'll have to put into production and maintain
for 5 years.
